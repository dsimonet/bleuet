# bleuet


Simple developpment of modules for hexapod robot. 

This robot is based on 18 9G chinese servo. They are cheap, not precise and absolutly not reliable.
But for a cheap Hexapod this is enought. 

For this kind of servo hexapod shoud be light as possible. So 3D printed part are smallest as possible.

See here on thingiverse : 

Bleuet name is tribute and cam from french version of TV serie FX special effect. This was the name of the small robot.
